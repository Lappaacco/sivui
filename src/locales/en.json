  "about": {
    "title": "Ilojaloin & me",
    "intro": "I am <strong>Satu Paunonen, podiatrist and entrepreneur from Vaasa</strong> – and a mother of four children. Exercise, creativity, and family keep me balanced, and people-oriented work is close to my heart. By nature, I am calm, friendly, and fundamentally positive. I am curious and enthusiastic about learning new things. I love developing my professional skills and appreciate that foot care is a field where you never finish learning – there's always something new to discover.",
    "journey": "I became a podiatrist through my own experiences. Since childhood, I have suffered from flat feet and various foot problems. Through them, I realized how significant feet are for overall wellbeing. I wanted to learn how I could help myself – and at the same time others – to feel better.",
    "education": "I graduated as a <strong>podiatrist in 2015 from Mikkeli University of Applied Sciences</strong> and have since worked at <strong>Vaasa Central Hospital's internal medicine outpatient clinic</strong>. I have also completed a <strong>basic taping course</strong> and continue to regularly develop myself in the field.",
    "passion": "My heart burns for working with podiatry, and as an entrepreneur, I can work from the heart – in my own way and at my own pace. It's important to me that clients feel heard and seen. I want to offer a calm, safe space where I can help each client individually and professionally."
