  "about": {
    "title": "Ilojaloin & me",
    "paragraph1": "I am <strong>Satu Paunonen, a podiatrist and entrepreneur from Vaasa</strong> – and a mother of four children. Exercise, creativity, and family keep me balanced, and working with people is close to my heart. By nature, I am calm, friendly, and fundamentally positive. I'm curious and enthusiastic about learning new things. I love developing my professional skills and appreciate that podiatry is a field where you never stop learning – there's always something new to discover.",
    "paragraph2": "I became a podiatrist through my own experiences. I've suffered from flat feet and various foot problems since childhood. Through these experiences, I realized how important feet are for overall well-being. I wanted to learn how I could help myself – and others – feel better.",
    "paragraph3": "I graduated as a <strong>podiatrist in 2015 from Mikkeli University of Applied Sciences</strong> and have since worked at <strong>Vaasa Central Hospital's internal medicine outpatient clinic</strong>. In my work, I've specialized in <strong>wound care, podiatry for diabetic and rheumatic patients, and treatment of various pain conditions and structural problems</strong>. Thanks to this experience, you can sit in my treatment chair with complete confidence – I've seen all kinds of feet.",
    "paragraph4": "Entrepreneurship has been on my mind for a long time – the freedom to work according to my own values, creatively and with a people-centered approach. Ilojaloin was born from my desire to help people feel better and promote foot health in a broad, preventive way. I want every visit to be a step towards a lighter, pain-free everyday life."

  "footTherapy": {
    "title": "Podiatry",
    "paragraph1": "Becoming a podiatrist requires <strong>healthcare education</strong> spanning <strong>3.5 years</strong>. The curriculum includes anatomy, physiology, and biomechanics. This enables me to understand how feet function, why problems develop, and how to prevent and treat them. I'm qualified to treat people with diabetes, rheumatism, circulation issues, and other special conditions.",
    "paragraph2": "Podiatry is preventive care that promotes mobility and quality of life. Regular foot, nail, and skin care prevents problems before they become serious. My goal is for every visit to bring relief, and in the long run, keep you on your feet."

  "services": {
    "title": "My Services",
    "intro": "At Ilojaloin, I offer <strong>comprehensive podiatry services</strong>, such as:",
    "items": [

    ],
    "outro": "Each treatment is planned according to the client's needs and carried out without rush, with warmth and professionalism. You can also come for podiatry without a specific problem or pain condition. Prevention is also important. By knowing your feet, you can care for them properly and avoid potential future problems. Foot health can always be improved, and it affects overall well-being!"

  "hygiene": {
    "title": "Safety and Hygiene",
    "paragraph1": "I have the highest quality and safest equipment on the market. My treatment chair is stable, sturdy, and easily lifts up to 225 kilograms. It lowers down, making it easy to get on.",
    "paragraph2": "When grinding skin and nails, I use a water drill that cools and binds dust – the skin doesn't heat up and grinding dust doesn't fly around in the air. This way, both you and I breathe clean air.",
    "paragraph3": "My foot mirror's low construction enables accurate assessment of foot load and position.",
    "paragraph4": "The instruments are washed, disinfected, dried, and maintained. They are then sterilized in an autoclave and stored in a closed box. The instrument cabinet is always handled with clean hands.",
    "paragraph5": "The premises are cleaned after each customer with effective agents that destroy bacteria, viruses, and fungi.",
    "paragraph6": "<strong>Your safety and well-being are most important to me.</strong>",
    "paragraph7": "I take equally careful care of the security of your customer data. I use the <strong>Vello patient data system</strong>, which is <strong>data-secure and Kanta-compatible</strong>, so your information remains protected and confidential."
