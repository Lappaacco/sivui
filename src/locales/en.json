  "about": {
    "title": "Ilojaloin & me",
    "paragraph1": "I am <strong>Satu Paunonen, a podiatrist and entrepreneur from Vaasa</strong> – as well as a mother of four children. Exercise, creativity, and family keep me balanced, and people-oriented work is a matter of the heart for me. By nature, I am calm, friendly, and fundamentally positive. I am curious and enthusiastic about learning new things. I love developing my professional skills and appreciate that foot care is a field where you never finish – there is always something new to learn.",
    "paragraph2": "I became a podiatrist through my own experiences. I have suffered from flat feet and various foot ailments since childhood. Through them, I understood how significant feet are for overall well-being. I wanted to learn how I could help myself – and at the same time others – to feel better.",
    "paragraph3": "I graduated as a <strong>podiatrist in 2015 from Mikkeli University of Applied Sciences</strong> and have since worked at <strong>Vaasa Central Hospital's internal medicine outpatient clinic</strong>. In my work, I have specialized in <strong>wound care, foot therapy for diabetics and rheumatism patients, and treatment of various pains and malpositions</strong>. Thanks to this work experience, you can sit in my treatment chair with complete confidence – all kinds of feet have been seen.",
    "paragraph4": "Entrepreneurship has been on my mind for a long time – the idea of freedom to work according to my own values, creatively and in a people-oriented way. Ilojaloin was born from the desire to help people feel better and promote foot health broadly and preventively. I want every encounter to be a step towards a lighter, pain-free everyday life."

  "footTherapy": {
    "title": "Foot therapy",
    "paragraph1": "Graduating as a podiatrist requires <strong>healthcare education</strong> that takes <strong>3.5 years</strong>. The studies include anatomy, physiology, and biomechanics. Therefore, I understand how feet work, why problems arise, and how to prevent and treat them. I am qualified to treat people with diabetes, rheumatism, circulation problems, and other special conditions.",
    "paragraph2": "Foot therapy is preventive care that promotes mobility and quality of life. Regular care of feet, nails, and skin prevents problems before they become serious. My goal is for every visit to bring relief, and in the long term, keep you on your feet."

  "hygiene": {
    "title": "Safety and Hygiene",
    "paragraph1": "Hygiene and safety are the cornerstones of foot therapy. All my tools and work practices meet the strictest healthcare requirements. I ensure that every client receives treatment in a safe and clean environment.",
    "paragraph2": "I work at the Vaasa Diaconia Institute on Sepänkatu 10. I share the facilities with other professionals, and the premises are clean and comfortable. <strong>My own equipment includes</strong>, among other things, a <strong>200-kilo treatment chair</strong> that is electronically adjustable and comfortably supports clients of all sizes. Treatments are carried out using a <strong>water drill</strong>, which is safer for nails than traditional cutting, and a <strong>grinder</strong> for precise skin and nail work.",
    "paragraph3": "All instruments are washed in an <strong>ultrasonic cleaner</strong>, packed, and sterilized in an <strong>autoclave (class B, prion programs)</strong>. This ensures that tools are completely sterile and safe. Each instrument packet is marked with a batch number, and I document when and where the instruments were used.",
    "paragraph4": "I document client visits in the <strong>Vello patient information system</strong>, and the information is transferred to Kanta services. This ensures that your care history is securely stored and available to you through your own Kanta pages.",
    "paragraph5": "I always use disposable gloves and disinfect my hands before and after each client. Files, polishing pads, and other disposable materials are used only once and disposed of properly. Treatment rooms and surfaces are disinfected between each client.",
    "paragraph6": "I regularly participate in continuing education to stay up-to-date with the latest practices and hygiene guidelines. <strong>My education and work experience guarantee that you receive professional and safe care</strong> – regardless of whether you come for basic care or the treatment of more challenging foot problems.",
    "paragraph7": "If you have questions about hygiene practices or other aspects of treatment, I'm happy to answer them. Your safety and well-being are always a priority."
