  "about": {
    "title": "Ilojaloin & me",
    "paragraph1": "I am <strong>Satu Paunonen, a podiatrist and entrepreneur from Vaasa</strong> – and a mother of four children. Exercise, creativity, and family keep me balanced, and working with people is close to my heart. By nature, I am calm, friendly, and fundamentally positive. I'm curious and enthusiastic about learning new things. I love developing my professional skills and appreciate that podiatry is a field where you never stop learning – there's always something new to discover.",
    "paragraph2": "I became a podiatrist through my own experiences. I've suffered from flat feet and various foot problems since childhood. Through these experiences, I realized how important feet are for overall well-being. I wanted to learn how I could help myself – and others – feel better.",
    "paragraph3": "I graduated as a <strong>podiatrist in 2015 from Mikkeli University of Applied Sciences</strong> and have since worked at <strong>Vaasa Central Hospital's internal medicine outpatient clinic</strong>. In my work, I've specialized in <strong>wound care, podiatry for diabetic and rheumatic patients, and treatment of various pain conditions and structural problems</strong>. Thanks to this experience, you can sit in my treatment chair with complete confidence – I've seen all kinds of feet.",
    "paragraph4": "Entrepreneurship has been on my mind for a long time – the freedom to work according to my own values, creatively and with a people-centered approach. Ilojaloin was born from my desire to help people feel better and promote foot health in a broad, preventive way. I want every visit to be a step towards a lighter, pain-free everyday life."

  "footTherapy": {
    "title": "Podiatry",
    "paragraph1": "Becoming a podiatrist requires <strong>healthcare education</strong> spanning <strong>3.5 years</strong>. The curriculum includes anatomy, physiology, and biomechanics. This enables me to understand how feet function, why problems develop, and how to prevent and treat them. I'm qualified to treat people with diabetes, rheumatism, circulation issues, and other special conditions.",
    "paragraph2": "Podiatry is preventive care that promotes mobility and quality of life. Regular foot, nail, and skin care prevents problems before they become serious. My goal is for every visit to bring relief, and in the long run, keep you on your feet."

    ],
    "outro": "Each treatment is planned according to the client's needs and carried out without rush, with warmth and professionalism. You can also come for podiatry without a specific problem or pain condition. Prevention is also important. By knowing your feet, you can care for them properly and avoid potential future problems. Foot health can always be improved, and it affects overall well-being!"

  "hygiene": {
    "title": "Safety and Hygiene",
    "paragraph1": "Hygiene and safety are the cornerstones of podiatry. All my tools and practices meet the strictest healthcare standards. I ensure every client receives treatment in a safe, clean environment.",
    "paragraph2": "I work at the Vaasa Diaconia Institute at Sepänkatu 10. I share the facilities with other professionals, and the premises are clean and comfortable. <strong>My equipment includes</strong> a <strong>200-kg treatment chair</strong> that's electronically adjustable and comfortably accommodates clients of all sizes. Treatments are performed using a <strong>water drill</strong>, which is safer for nails than traditional cutting, and a <strong>grinder</strong> for precise skin and nail work.",
    "paragraph3": "All instruments are washed in an <strong>ultrasonic cleaner</strong>, packaged, and sterilized in an <strong>autoclave (Class B, prion programs)</strong>. This ensures tools are completely sterile and safe. Each instrument package is labeled with a batch number, and I document when and where the instruments were used.",
    "paragraph4": "I document client visits in the <strong>Vello patient information system</strong>, and the information transfers to Kanta services. This ensures your treatment history is securely stored and accessible through your Kanta portal.",
    "paragraph5": "I always wear disposable gloves and disinfect my hands before and after each client. Files, polishing pads, and other disposable materials are single-use and properly disposed of. Treatment rooms and surfaces are disinfected between clients.",
    "paragraph6": "I regularly participate in continuing education to stay current with best practices and hygiene guidelines. <strong>My education and work experience guarantee professional, safe care</strong> – whether you're coming for routine maintenance or treatment of complex foot problems.",
    "paragraph7": "If you have questions about hygiene practices or any aspect of treatment, I'm happy to answer. Your safety and well-being are always my priority."
